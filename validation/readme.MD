## Validation of Oil Palm Map using Picture Pile

In order to validate the oil palm map, we created a stratified sample with approximately 1500 points per region. The sample was stratified based on agreement of three maps: Cheng, Kemen and Danylo. We placed 25% of the points in the area where all three maps agree on presence of oil palm, 25% where all three maps agree on absence of oil palm, and rest 50% of the points in the areas of disagreement of these maps.

The validation data was collected using Picture Pile app. A separate campaign was set up. Volunteers were presented with the high resolution background imagery (Google Maps, Bing) and were asked the question about the presence of oil palm in the red square box. If more than 50% of the square was covered with oil palm, an user was asked to swipe right, otherwise - to the left.
