## High-resolution oil palm detection across South-East Asia

Repository for detection of oil palm in [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/).

In this study we develop an approach to map oil palm on a large scale for South East Asia including age of plantations. Our pixel-based classification approach uses a set of input features derived from Copernicus Sentinel-1 data as well as from additional auxiliary datasets. The high resolution and frequency of Sentinel-1 observations enables us to detect not only large oil palm plantations, but also smallholder farms under 1ha in size. Using a continuous flow of Sentinel-1 data we aim to make our approach operational and enable oil palm plantation expansion monitoring.
